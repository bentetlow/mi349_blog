                    in the intire world people travel from all over
                    the world to watch their team play

                <p> THe team with the most world cup wins is brazil with 5 world cup wins
                    the last team to win a world cup was France. The favorites for this years world cup
                    is Brazil followed by argentina as the second favorites. England invented the worldcup
                    but has only one the trophy once despite having one of the most talented temas in the world 
                    each world cup.

                <p> This will be Messi and Ronaldo's last time suiting up for a world Cup
                    with their respected countries. Both of these players will go down as two of the greatest players to ever grace a soccer field 
                    however neither of them have been able to win a world cup for thier country which is probably the biggest honor one could wish
                    to accomplish. With the potential of a ronaldo vs messi, a Portugal vs argentina final this world cup could prove to be one of the 
                    exciting ones ever, and most influential in who goes down as the best to ever play.
